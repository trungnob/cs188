<em>Due 04/09/07 at 11:59pm</em><br>
<span class="style2">
<p><strong>What to submit:</strong> You will fill in portions of <code>battleshipAgent.py</code>
(only) during the assignment, and submit it.&nbsp; The only other file you
should submit is a readme in .txt or .pdf format in which you answer the written
portion of this assignment.</p>
<h2>Part 1: Written Assignment </h2>
<p><em><strong>Question 1 (5 points)&nbsp; </strong></em>Consider the following
network, in which a mouse agent is reasoning about the behavior of a cat.&nbsp;
The mouse really wants to know whether the cat will attack (A), which depends on
whether the cat is hungry (H) and whether the cat is sleepy (S).&nbsp; The mouse
can observe two things, whether the cat is sleepy (S) and whether the cat has a
collar (C). The cat is more often sleepy (S) when it's either full (f) or
starved (v) than when it is peckish (p) and the collar (C) tends to indicate
that the cat is not starved.&nbsp; Note that entries are omitted, such as P(C=~c),
when their complements are given.</p>

<p>In this part, you will design agents for a variant of the game of <a href="http://www.superkids.com/aweb/tools/logic/bship/">Battleship</a>.&nbsp;
In this game, you must locate the opponent's ships on a grid using sensors, and
then guess their locations.&nbsp; For this project, the ships do not move.</p>

<h3>Battleship and BNs</h3>
<p>In this cs188 version game of battleship, the goal is to locate and bomb the
battleship(s) hiding on the grid.&nbsp; Unlike in classic battleship, however,
you aren't guessing at random.&nbsp; You can obtain information about the ships'
whereabouts by dropping sensors at grid positions.&nbsp; These sensors return
readings, which are correlated with the distance to the closest ship.&nbsp; You only have one bomb per ship, and bombing, successful or not,
ends the game.&nbsp; There are two tasks of interest in this game.&nbsp; First,
we would like to compute probability distributions over ship locations given
sensor readings.&nbsp; This is the inference problem.&nbsp; Second, we want to
decide, given our current beliefs about ship locations, whether to sense or
bomb, and where.&nbsp; This is the decision problem.&nbsp; You will build agents
to solve both of these problems.</p>
<p>You can probably figure out the rules just by playing, but here's the
official version:</p>
<p>At any time, you can sense or bomb.&nbsp; If you wish to sense, left-click
a grid location, and you will reveal the sensor reading at that location.&nbsp;
You cannot &quot;re-sense&quot; the same location.&nbsp; The intuition is that
time is frozen and your observation, though noisy, will not change until the
world changes (which it will not do for this assignment).&nbsp; The
observation you get from a sensor will be one of <code>RED, ORANGE, YELLOW,</code> or <code>GREEN</code>,
which roughly indicates how close the closest ship is to the sensor
location.&nbsp; The exact sensor model is given in <code>sensorDistributions.py</code>.&nbsp;
You lose one point per sensor revealed.</p>
<p>Once you are ready to bomb, click the BOMB button. It will turn red to
indicate that you are in bombing mode.&nbsp; All you can do now is drop as many
bombs as there are ships on the board.&nbsp; Once all your bombs are used up,
you will see which were hits and which were misses.&nbsp; All ships in any squares
you bomb are hit (you can hit multiple ships with a single bomb if you're
lucky).&nbsp; You gain 50 points for each ship you hit.</p>
<p>To get started with battleship, let's play a few games.&nbsp; Run battleship
from the command line:</p>
<p><code>&nbsp; python battleship.py -w -q</code></p>
<p>As before, there are many command-line options, which you can display with
the <code>-h</code> option.&nbsp; In this case, the <code>-w</code> flag shows
the true locations of the ships, and the <code>-q</code> flag suppresses the
display of agent beliefs (since you have no agent yet).</p>
<p>Left-click to sensor a square or click the bomb button to begin
bombing.&nbsp; Remember that once you bomb, the game will end, whether you hit
the ship or not.&nbsp; Try a bigger layout using (<code>-l medium</code>).&nbsp;
Now, using (<code>-l test</code>), a 3 by 3 layout, try sensing all 9 squares.
Notice that there is no noise in the sensor readings -- that is, the information
provided by <code>RED, ORANGE, YELLOW,</code> and <code>GREEN</code> is
deterministic given the location of the ship.&nbsp; You can set the sensor
reading distribution at the command line with (<code>-s noisy</code>). Take a
look at <code>sensorDistributions.py</code> to see what the deterministic and noisy
distributions look like.&nbsp; It should be more difficult to find the ship
using the noisy distribution.&nbsp; Try some games on the medium layout with
noisy sensors and no true locations to get an idea of what we're asking the
agents to do!</p>
<p><em><strong>Question 0 (no points)&nbsp; </strong></em>Work through the brief
tutorial (<code>tutorial.py</code>), which provides an introduction to the major
battleship classes and functions you will find helpful.</p>
<p>Let's formalize the static battleship domain as a Bayes' net.&nbsp; The full
network structure is shown below (for a 2x3 layout):</p>
<p><center><img width="300" src="bn-1.png"></center></p>
<p>The S node represents the tuple of ship positions.&nbsp; You could imagine
having a separate variable for each ship; this formulation is equivalent.&nbsp;
You can get the prior distribution over ship tuples from <code>Game.getShipTupleDistribution()</code>.&nbsp;
In general, there are a lot of important <code>Game.getX()</code> methods, and
your agents and inference modules will have <code>self.game</code>
objects.&nbsp; Note that if there is only one ship in play, you will still get
singleton tuples of locations, not just a bare location.&nbsp; There is a random
variable R<sub>i,j</sub> for each position (row, col) = (i, j).&nbsp; Each
reading depends only on the ship position.&nbsp; The conditional distribution
for R<sub>i,j</sub> given a value for S can be fetched with <code>Game.getReadingDistributionGivenShipTuple()</code>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Question 1 (6 points)&nbsp; </strong></em>Try running without the
<code>-q</code> flag, if you haven't already.&nbsp; The GUI will now display the
agent's posterior beliefs about the location of the ship (S) given the revealed
sensors ({R<sub>i,j</sub>=r<sub>i,j</sub>}).&nbsp; However, as you haven't
written anything yet, there is a placeholder which always returns the
uniform distribution over locations.&nbsp; Look at the <code>StaticKeyboardAgent</code>,
which is actually playing the game: it delegates action choice to you, the
human, and uses an <code>ExactStaticInferenceModule</code> to compute
distributions over ships.&nbsp; You will implement the function <code>getShipTupleDistributionGivenObservations()</code>
in the <code>ExactStaticInferenceModule</code> class in <code>battleshipAgent.py</code>.&nbsp;
It takes a dictionary of location / reading pair and should calculate the
posterior distribution over the location of a ship given those
observations.&nbsp; The returned object should be a dictionary which has all singleton tuples of all the
grid locations as keys and posterior probabilities (that the ship is in that
position) as values.&nbsp; You might try printing out the observations as you
play to see what they look like.&nbsp; Test your agent by playing with noiseless
sensors (<code>-s deterministic</code>, which is the default). You also might
use <code>-w</code> to show the true ship position for debugging.&nbsp; Once
your code seems to be working, try noisy sensor distributions (<code>-s noisy</code>).&nbsp;
Note that thanks to your results in the question 2 in part 1, you can ignore all unobserved reading
variables when you compute the posterior over S.  That is, you can treat the network on the left as if it were the one on the right:</p>
<center><img width="300" src="bn-2.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width="295" src="bn-3.png"></center>
<p><strong><em>Question 2 (7 points) </em></strong>You can put multiple ships on
the board with the <code>-k</code> option.&nbsp; Try a game with <code>-k 2 -q</code>.&nbsp;
You now need to make sure your inference works correctly for the case of
multiple ships; it may already be correct, depending on how you coded your answer to question
1 (you will only turn in this more general version).&nbsp; Whereas before S was essentially a ship position, it is now a ship
tuple, and so we are calculating posteriors over ship tuples.&nbsp; For example,
if we have 2 ships, we calculate the posterior probability of (ship1, ship2)
being ((0,0), (0,0)), ((0,0), (0,1)), and so on.&nbsp; Because the ships are
interchangeable, you will never know which exact ship is in which location, but
you may know which k locations are occupied.&nbsp; When there are multiple
ships, the GUI will display the expected number of ships at each location.&nbsp;
We have provided a function in the mostly abstract <code>StaticBattleshipAgent</code>
class called <code>getExpectedShipCounts()</code> which extracts expected counts
from your posterior over S; make sure you understand this method.&nbsp; In the
single-ship case, the expected ships counts are just the beliefs we compute in <code>getShipTupleDistributionGivenObservations()</code>.&nbsp;
In the k-ship case, however, the expected number of ships across all locations will
be k.&nbsp; For example, you may have a posterior that ((0,0), (0,1)) is 0.5 and
((0,1), (0,0)) is 0.5, at which point both of (0,0) and (0,1) will have expected
counts of 1.0.&nbsp; Try your code with 2 and 3 ships. Make sure you understand
why inference slows down as k increases.</p>

<p><em><strong>Question 3 (7 points) </strong></em>You will now write a new agent, which makes decisions using your inference
code.&nbsp; The simplest decision to make is where to bomb given current beliefs
over ship locations S.&nbsp; This computation is basically an expectimax
computation, shown diagrammatically below.&nbsp; At the root max node, you can
select any bombing option (tuple of k squares), and the expected utility (score)
is the max over all actions' expected utilities.&nbsp; Each action will produce
an expected utility which is the expected number of ships in those squares times
the score per ship, <code>BATTLESHIP_SCORE</code>.
<p><center><img width="300" src="tree-1.png"></center></p>
<p>However, you need not bomb right away.&nbsp; Instead, you might sense first,
revealing a single new reading, and then bomb.&nbsp; In this case, you would
have various sensing actions available to you.&nbsp; Each sensing action leads
to a chance node with a distribution P(R<sub>i,j</sub> | {r}), which describes
the agent's beliefs about what reading will emerge at that location, given the
previous readings.&nbsp; For each such new reading, we will have an optimal
bombing option and the new accompanying expected utility.&nbsp; You agent should
usually take the sensing action which reveals the reading which has the largest
value of information, that is, expected gain in maximum expected utility.&nbsp;
However, once the value of the information is less that 1 point, it should stop
sensing and bomb.&nbsp; In deciding its actions, your agent does not evaluate the futures
in which it senses multiple times (though it may indeed end up sensing multiple times).&nbsp;
This decision process is therefore not optimal; the
optimal agent would also explicitly consider the possibility of sensing more than once
before bombing.&nbsp; In other words, you have an agent with look-ahead depth 2
for its action selection.</p>
<p>The search tree for this process is represented in the following diagram:</p>
<p><center><img width="300" src="tree-2.png"></center></p>
<p>Build an agent which not only
computes posterior beliefs, but also makes decisions, using the at-most-one-sensor
look-ahead described above.&nbsp; The agent can either bomb or sense, if that is worthwhile to do so, by looking
ahead 1 step. Note that the agent can do multiple sensing steps before bombing, but it just look-ahead only one step
in advance. You will need to fill in code in <code>StaticVPIAgent.getAction()</code>
and <code>ExactStaticInferenceModule.getReadingDistributionGivenObservations()</code>.&nbsp;
You may wish to think first about the one-ship case before generalizing to the
multi-ship case, but the code should be the same either way.&nbsp; Test your VPI
agent with (<code>-p vpi</code>), first using deterministic sensors (<code>-s
deterministic</code>) and then with noisy sensors (<code>-s noisy</code>).&nbsp;
It should work very well in the deterministic case, but might sometimes make obviously
non-optimal decisions in the noisy case, because of the limited look-ahead.Make sure your code run at reasonable
speed for the 1 and 2 ships cases in the small board, and 1 ship cases in larger boards.</p>
